refreshed subscription
yum started to work		learn virtual env to safely run pip
maybe i updated yum?
--i installed pip with yum
intsalled python3 with yum https://docs.vmware.com/en/VMware-vSphere-Bitfusion/4.0/Example-Guide/GUID-D3A136D1-0EA1-4CD0-AFCF-7FD88299A53A.html

--install paramiko?
python -m pip install --user paramiko
--argcomplete and activation
python -m pip install argcomplete
sudo activate-global-python-argcomplete

now i need to install python, and then ansible next and begin the work
need to install some required modules. first is passlib. must use python w/ pip
 python -m pip install passlib
now another
 python -m pip install jmespath
--installing role !! --check will do dry run
ansible-galaxy install git+https://github.com/mindpointgroup/rhel7-stig
it installed to /root/.ansible/roles/rhel7-stig, as root was the home dir for root user
--mass customization
defaults/main.yml
-- stop individual stig
rhel_07_######: true
-- for key based auth!
install openssh, auth into servers with workstations to avoid pass auth (this is more secure) its already installed
--create your own key pair with passphrase for users (nothing to do with ansible)
also we will need a key for ansible to automate the connections. ocpy this key to each server
--give keys
ssh-keygen . made in ~/.ssh/. ssh-copy-id -i path/to/pub/key user@controlnode
-- for give ansible key, make key with no passphrase now
now when you copy, old key will facilitate the adding with passphrase!
-ssh in using ansible key
ssh -i ~/.ssh/ansible user@ip - will remote in without pwd or psphrase!
-made github repo, added pubkey from control node to my repo
--cloned git repo
--git commands give other person your pub key for auth
git add newfile
git commit -m "message"
git push
--the ansible all ping!
ansible all --key-file ~/.ssh/id_rsa -i ~/ansible_project/inventory -m ping
used my private key to auth in and the git project invetory as hosts. -m ping
- go back and find how this was automated
--become --ask-become-pass 
prompts for password when executing on remote hosts
